# Criminal Records Management System (CRMS)

## Overview

The Criminal Records Management System (CRMS) is a web-based application designed to efficiently manage criminal records through an intuitive and user-friendly interface. This system allows users to add, view, edit, and delete criminal records seamlessly. The frontend of the system is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, ensuring a responsive and interactive experience directly from the browser. Additionally, there's an optional **Java** component for managing records via a standalone application without the need for a backend server.

## Features
- Add New Record: Easily add new criminal records with details such as name, crime, date of crime, and sentence.
- View Records: Display all criminal records in a neatly formatted table.
- Edit Records: Modify existing criminal records with ease.
- Delete Records: Remove unwanted or incorrect criminal records from the system.
