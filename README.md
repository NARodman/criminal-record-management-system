# Criminal Records Management System (CRMS)

## Overview

The Criminal Records Management System is a web-based application designed to help manage criminal records in an efficient, user-friendly manner. This system consists of several pages that allows the user to add, view, and manage criminal records. The frontend of the system is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, with potential integreations for backend integrations via **Java**. 

## Project Structure 

**index.html**: The homepage that serves as the main dashboard, offering quick navigation to other parts of the system.
**addCriminal.html**: A form users can input criminal record details (name, crime, date of crime, sentence).
**listCriminal.html**: Displays a table of all criminal records in the system. This page will later be connected to the backend to fetch real time data. 
**editCriminal**: A form that allows the users to view and edit the details of an existing criminal record.
